# **Mining Employee Reviews: What Glassdoor.com Reveals About Company Culture**

**What I did:**

In my final project (Mining Employee Reviews: What Glassdoor.com Reveals About Company Culture), I used statistical analysis methods such as normality and ANOVA tests to establish a correlation between job satisfaction and company culture which I further investigated using sentiment analysis and different classification algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, Na√Øve Bayes an kNN. For these classifications, I used categorical as well as numeric data deriving from word embeddings I created using the neural networks library Keras in R.
